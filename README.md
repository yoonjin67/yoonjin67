## 🧠 Research Assistant Certificates
![Researches](./certs.png)
The award was focused on presentation.
Plus, there can be some problem while uploading collaborated code into this.
So, I attach the actual award.

![IndustrialEngineer](./industrial_engineer.png)
This needs some comments. I took 'Industrial Engineer' examination 's first screening, as I were not an undergradute student.
And I took a final test in 2025. If I can get enough time to get 'Engineer' examination, which is one step higher than 'Industrial Engineer', I have courage to take.
First screening test's pass rate was 51%. Final test's pass wate was 49.64%, which is quite easier than 2023-2024's test.
